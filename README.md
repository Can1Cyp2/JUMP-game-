# JUMP! - A Game by Sebastian Landry

## About the Game

**JUMP!** is a fun and challenging platformer game I created in Grade 11 (2020). In this game, you'll guide your character through various levels, jumping from platform to platform, avoiding enemies and trying not to fall off. The goal? Reach the star at the top to win!


## Game Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels:** Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes. Each level has its own unique layout, with levels getting more difficult and obstacles getting trickier as you progress.
- **Pick Your Character:** You can play as one of three different characters, each with its own style.
- **Obstacles and Enemies:** The game isn't just about jumping! Watch out for enemies that can end your run and trampolines that will launch you into the air.
- **Soundtrack:** Enjoy background music that adds to the excitement and theme of the game.


## How to Play

The gameplay is simple but keeps you on your toes. Your mission is to reach the star at the top of each level while dodging enemies and making sure you don't fall off the map. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move, and hit the spacebar to jump. But don’t linger too long on a platform or you might find yourself in danger!

### Controls

- **Move Left:** Left Arrow or `A`
- **Move Right:** Right Arrow or `D`
- **Jump:** Up Arrow, `W`, or Spacebar
- **Return to Main Menu:** Backspace

## The Making of JUMP!

I made **JUMP!** as a school project when I was in Grade 11. It was my first real dive into game development, and I used Python with the Pygame library to bring it to life. It was a fun challenge to create something that others could enjoy, and it taught me greatly about coding and game design along the way.
Also, if I were to remake this game now, I would change a lot of the code. Ultimately, making it cleaner, more precise and playing it less glitchy.
